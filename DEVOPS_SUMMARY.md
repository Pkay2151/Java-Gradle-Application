 # DevOps Principles in This Java Gradle Project

## Automation
- Gradle automates building, testing, and packaging the Java application.
- GitHub Actions automates CI/CD workflows, ensuring every code change is automatically built and tested.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Every push or pull request triggers the GitHub Actions workflow, running builds and tests to catch issues early.

## Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
- The workflow can be extended to deploy artifacts to servers or cloud platforms, enabling rapid and reliable delivery.
- Artifacts (JAR files) are uploaded automatically for further deployment or distribution.

## Collaboration
- Version control (Git) and pull requests facilitate team collaboration and code review.
- Automated checks in CI/CD provide immediate feedback to all contributors.

## Monitoring & Feedback
- Build and test results are visible in the GitHub Actions UI, providing instant feedback on code quality and integration status.
